# Upgrade Playground

This repository was created to show you how your Portal 2.0 implementation would look as a Platform implementation. You are able to run both the Start-Portal-2 and Finish-Platform folders individually to see just how this would work.

## Running the solutions
### Start-Portal-2

Navigate into the `Start-Portal-2` directory. This Vanilla JS solution uses CDNs to load all dependencies, so you can run a native Python server to run this and test it. For Python 3 (most common), you can run `python3 -m http.server 8000` and then go to localhost:8000 in your browser and you'll see the index.html page running. *_Note_* In order for the Flatfile importer to work properly, you will have to utilize a web server to run it, otherwise Flatfile will never load and the button will not work. 

### Start Finish-Platform

Go into the `Finish-Platform` directory.
